    <!-- Absolute path: it starts from root directory like C drive then travserse to destination file/
     project -->
    <!-- Relative path: it starts from current directory and we can traverse up level or down or in current
    really useful in web even when project folder moves somewhere the path will be valid  -->

    <!-- In Relative path, ./ means search in current directory
    ../ means move to up level like parent folder of project folder maybe 
    -->

    <h2>Rabbit:</h2>
    <!-- since rabbit image is in current folder (folder 0) we use ./ notation -->

    <h2>Cat:</h2>
    <!-- we use ./ in this case bcz folder 3 is inside folder 0 which contains index file -->

    <h2>Dog:</h2>
    <!-- we use ../ bcz dog image is present outside the Folder 0 -->
    <img src="../dog.png" alt="Dog" height="200px" />

    <h2>Fish:</h2>
    <!-- we use ../ to get outside of Folder 0 and then move to Folder 1 which contains fish image -->
    <img src="../Folder1/fish.png" alt="Fish" height="200px" />

    <h2>Bird:</h2>
    <!-- bird image is outside the folder 0 thats why we use ../ notation to get outside and the traverse
    to folder 1 then folder 2 where bird image is present -->
